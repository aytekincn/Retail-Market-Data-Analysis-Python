## Retail Market Data Analysis With Python

## About Dataset
The dataset contains sales details of different stores of a supermarket chain that has multiple stores in different parts of the US.

## What I did in this project
- Data Cleaning: Removing duplicated indexes from data. Delete unuseful columns. Replace column names.
- Data Analysing: Analysing the data state, city numbers, highest, lowest sales, highest profits.
- Data Visualization: Retail market sales visualization by states, cities, category sales and profits.
